WORKING WITH @HttpExchange
==========================



Create two services
===================

add dependencies ---> spring web, spring webflux

let's assume we have one service as customer service and another services as customer client service where it
consumes customer service

customer service is normal spring boot REST API





To consume that service we need to do
following changes in customer client service
============================================

create one interface and annotate that with @HttpExchange as below

@HttpExchange("/api/v1/customer-service")
public interface CustomerClientService {
	
	@GetExchange
	 List<Customer> getAllCustomersFromCustomerService();

}

we need to create configuration class also as below

@Configuration
public class AppClientConfig {
	
	@Bean
	public WebClient webClient() {
		return WebClient.builder()
				.baseUrl("http://localhost:8080")
				.build();
	}
	
	@Bean
	public CustomerClientService customerClientService() {
		HttpServiceProxyFactory httpServiceProxyFactory=HttpServiceProxyFactory.
				builder(WebClientAdapter.forClient(webClient())).
				build();
		return httpServiceProxyFactory.createClient(CustomerClientService.class);
	}
}
